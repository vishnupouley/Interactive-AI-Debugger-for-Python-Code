# Introduction
This project details the development of a Python code debugging and explanation tool. Leveraging the Gradio framework for its intuitive front-end interface and the Groq API for powerful Language Model (LLM) integration, this application aims to assist users in understanding and resolving issues within their Python code. The core functionality revolves around a chat interface where users can submit code snippets and error messages, receiving AI-generated explanations and corrected code in return. A key feature of this implementation is the persistence of chat history, ensuring that conversations remain accessible across page refreshes as long as the local server is running.
